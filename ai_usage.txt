I used artificial intelligence, namely chat gpt to generate a script, namely for this line:` ps --sort=-%mem -eo pid,%mem,comm | head -n 11`.
I also used it to generate all the code for the service file.
And he helped me with the commands to run the script correctly and get the information correctly.
I asked a question about how to copy the script. And what needs to be written so that the installation of packages does not require interaction with the user.
